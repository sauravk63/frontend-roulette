10/26:
---------

instance variable vs local variable
no multiple inheritance in java
no const in java -> use final
private variables can only be used inside the class


INHERITANCE -> subclass, superclass
POLYMORPHISM -> method overriding, method overloading
ENCAPSULATION
ABSTRACTION


## JVM
- Heap Memory => Objects variables/methods
- Stack Memory => Local variables/objects with address to their data stored in heap memory
- static variables/methods


Final -> stops method overloading, stops class inheriting, stops modifying variables


-- Access modifiers:
 - Public
 - Default
 - Protected
 - Private
 

-- Abstract & Interface:
 - Interface can have multiple classes(uses implements instead of extends)
